# CIA World Factbook

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

    population - The population as of 2015.
    population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
    area - The total land and water area.

You can download the SQLite database, factbook.db, from this GitHub repo if you want to work with it on your own computer. In this guided project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database.
